# reality-facets

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/realityforge/reality-facets.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/realityforge/reality-facets)

A basic toolkit for binding facets or extensions to model objects. These classes
were extracted from several existing toolkits, primarily [Domgen](https://github.com/realityforge/domgen).
All of these toolkits have mechanisms for constructing model objects and then extending the standard
model with "facet" information that extended the model in a specific context.
